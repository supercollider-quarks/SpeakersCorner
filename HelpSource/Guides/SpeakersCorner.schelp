Description::

SpeakersCorner is a collection of tools for Multi-Speaker setups:

SpatioScope		displays loudspeaker setups in 2D layouts, shows audio levels on the speakers

list::
##link::Classes/Latency:: measures overall audio hardware latency, and overall delay times for each channel, i.e. including sound travel from loudspeakers to mic; can be used to compensate distances for a given listening/microphone location

##link::Classes/SpeakerAdjust:: adjust delaytime, level and optional EQ for individual speaker channels

##link::Classes/Spectralyzer:: displays frequency response of a signal, e.g. a loudspeaker by microphone,
can be used to tune by channel with link::Classes/SpeakerAdjust::
::

Some multichannel panning classes:
list::
##link::Classes/TorusPanAz:: for concentric rings of speakers

##link::Classes/PanRingTop:: for ring + a top speaker

##link::Classes/PanRingTopBot:: for rings, a top and a bottom speaker
